## Basics of Issues
- Good Issue Etiquette
  - One issue per issue
  - Title are straight to the point
  - Provide evidence -> screenshots, video, copies of error
  - Identify steps -> repro/qa
- Utilize `tasks list` to quickly track tasks to be completed  in the issue
  - `- [ ] Error`
  - [ ] Commit code once the course has been completed. 
- Utilize `labels` along side issues to quickly identify issues by type/category
  - 9 standard labels provided by GitHub
  - Ability to create custom labels
- Milestones (More info in projects section)
- Templates are provided for default markup related to the type of issue template
  - [GitHub Doc on configuring issue templates for a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
  - Default template for bug reports is a great best practice imo
