## Working With Git
- Version control
- Easily collaboration of code
- Two types of Version Control Architecutre
-- Centralized 
--- Single storage location for code
--- Tracking and Retrieval are all happening on the same server
--- Apache SubVersioN (popular software for centralized version)
-- Distributed
--- Clone (copy) of the source code
--- Source code (on server) is considered the "working copy"
--- Push/Pull code from the source code
- What is Git?
-- Version Control
-- Time Machine
-- Check points (commits)
-- Multiverse (branches)
-- Synchronize (merging)
- Rebasing
-- Allows you to take the changes from one branch and apply them onto another
-- This is the time machine part of Git as it lets you rewrite the commit history
