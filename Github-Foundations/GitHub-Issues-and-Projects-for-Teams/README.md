- Utilize `labels` along side issues to quickly identify issues by type/category
  - 9 standard labels provided by GitHub
  - Ability to create custom labels

- Templates are provided for default markup related to the type of issue template
  - [GitHub Doc on configuring issue templates for a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
